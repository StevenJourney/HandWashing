### Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis: A Data-Driven Journey
Welcome to this interactive tutorial where you step into the shoes of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818. Dr. Semmelweis worked at the Vienna General Hospital during a critical period in medical history. Let’s explore his groundbreaking work and learn valuable data analysis techniques along the way.

## Background
In the 1800s, medical knowledge was far from what we know today. People attributed illnesses to “bad air” or malevolent spirits. However, a shift occurred as doctors began to focus on anatomy, perform autopsies, and base their arguments on data.

Dr. Semmelweis noticed a disturbing trend: Many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (also known as puerperal fever). He suspected that something was going wrong with the hospital procedures. His mission? To uncover the truth using data.

## Keys Take Away
Essential skills for data analysis:

1. Compelling Arguments with Data:
* Understand how data can drive impactful conclusions.
* Learn to make persuasive arguments based on evidence.
2. Histograms and Distributions:
* Superimpose histograms to visualize differences in data distributions.
* Use Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) for smoother distribution graphics.
3. Statistical Significance with T-Tests:
* Employ scipy to test for statistical significance.
Explore p-values and their implications.
4. Time Series Visualization:
* Highlight specific segments of time series charts using Matplotlib.
5. Adding Legends and Customization:
* Configure legends in Matplotlib for clear visual communication.
6. NumPy’s .where() Function:
* Process elements conditionally using NumPy.
